---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

**Inefficient Study Methods:** Students waste countless hours revising concepts they already understand while neglecting weaker areas that require focused attention. This misallocation of study time leads to suboptimal exam performance and increased stress levels.

**Lack of Personalization:** Traditional assessments and study materials follow a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to offer personalized feedback and preparation strategies. Students receive generic study plans that don't account for their individual learning patterns, strengths, and weaknesses.

**Generic Preparation:** Most available exam preparation tools provide static content and assessments that don't adapt to student performance levels. This approach doesn't cater to individual learning needs and fails to provide targeted improvement strategies.

**No Adaptive Difficulty:** Static tests and practice materials don't adjust to student performance levels, leading to either overwhelming difficulty or insufficient challenge. This results in poor engagement and ineffective learning outcomes.

**Limited Actionable Feedback:** Students typically receive grades or scores without specific improvement guidance. They know what they got wrong but not why they got it wrong or how to improve, leading to repeated mistakes and frustration.

### Target Impact
Students preparing for B.Tech exams need smart, adaptive support that identifies knowledge gaps and provides focused study recommendations. The solution should transform the traditional approach to exam preparation by making it more efficient, personalized, and effective.
